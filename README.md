The Relativity Agent Agent is an agent management system controlled by an agent. The current master branch is working if added to a Relativity instance, but I am continuing to add new Agent Types and will create a UI to fine tune agent settings from the front-end.

At this time, the Agent Agent manages the following agent types--
- Assisted Review Manager 
- Branding Manager 
- Cache Manager
- Case Manager
- Case Statistics Manager
- Cluster Upgrade Worker
- Distributed Job Manager
- OCR Set Manager
- OCR Worker
- Processing Set Manager
- Production Manager
- Server Manager
